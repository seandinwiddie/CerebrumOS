Creating a conceptual CerebrumOS with a focus on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Using Java and creating a Redux.java library for state management (ported and maintained from Redux.js).

### 1. Frontal Lobe - Thoughts and Decision-Making:

The "frontal lobe" directory represents high-level thought processes and decision-making. Redux.java and chatgpt api can help manage commands, thoughts, and decision-making.

First, ensure Redux.java integration in the project. Add the Redux library or JAR file to the project's dependencies.

```java
import redux.Reducer;
import redux.Store;
import redux.createStore;

// Define an action type for updating thoughts
final String UPDATE_THOUGHTS = "UPDATE_THOUGHTS";

// Define an action type for making decisions
final String MAKE_DECISION = "MAKE_DECISION";

// Create a reducer to handle thought and decision actions
Reducer<String> thoughtsReducer = (state, action) -> {
    switch (action.getType()) {
        case UPDATE_THOUGHTS:
            return action.getPayload();
        case MAKE_DECISION:
            // Implement the decision-making logic here
            return "Decision made: " + action.getPayload();
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

// Create a Redux store with the thoughts reducer
Store<String> frontalLobeStore = createStore(thoughtsReducer, "");

// Dispatch an action to update thoughts
frontalLobeStore.dispatch(new ReduxAction<>(UPDATE_THOUGHTS, "New thought"));

// Dispatch an action to make a decision
frontalLobeStore.dispatch(new ReduxAction<>(MAKE_DECISION, "Decision details"));

// Get the current state of thoughts
String currentThoughts = frontalLobeStore.getState();

```

This example demonstrates a basic thought management and decision-making in the "Frontal Lobe" using Redux.java. Expand this with the actual decision-making logic.

Apply a similar structure for other components of the CerebrumOS, like the "Limbic System," "Sensory Processing," and so on, based on the specific requirements. Make sure to handle API requests, hardware integrations, and other functionalities within these components.

### 2. Limbic System - Emotions and Memories:

The "limbic_system" directory handles emotions and memories. Implementing emotional states and memory management using Redux.java and chatgpt api.

```java

```

### 3. Sensory Processing - Vision and Hearing:

Emulating sensory input in a thought processing system can involve using device hardware, such as the camera and microphone. Redux.java can process this data and chatgpt api.

```java

```

### 4. Motor Control - Voluntary Movements:

Use Redux.java and chatgpt api to control drone actions.

```java

```

### 5. Thalamus and Hypothalamus - Sleep Regulation:

Sleep/charging regulation involves managing the device's power state and sleep mode.

```java

```

### 6. Temporal Lobe - Language and Memory:

Implementing language processing and memory management using Redux.java and chatgpt api.

```java

```

**Notes & Todo**

1. **Complex Features**: Develop more complex features, such as managing system resources, networking, and hardware interactions.
   
2. **Code Snippets**: The code snippets provided above are simplified examples. They demonstrate how Redux.java can be applied to emulate brain functionalities.
   
**Project Objective**: Adapt and expand these ideas to build a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of CerebrumOS. This operating system should be compatible with current computing device hardware and incorporate basic autonomous hovering/flying drone capabilities for movement. It should also include the default ChatGPT API functionality within the low-level system processes.

**Nature of CerebrumOS**: CerebrumOS is conceptualized as a server OS without a graphical user interface. Its primary goal is to utilize available device hardware, mimicking the functions of organic grey matter in a de-evolved or primal/fetal state of growth. The long-term vision is to transition from current computing hardware to lab-grown organic grey matter (abstractly tweening from current computing hardware to developing [over a long process into the very distant future] lab grown organic grey matter and the ultimate inevitable reality of such).

**Modular Approach**: Break down each functional component, like "Thoughts and Decision-Making" or "Emotions," into their own set of code files.

**Code Organization**: Decomposing the code into separate modules/packages for each "brain" area. Further divide these modules into distinct Java packages. This will facilitate codebase maintenance and scalability.

**Docs**: Create man pages in a Unix-like format for documentation.

**Redux Integration**: Maintain Redux.java, ensuring it aligns with Redux.js updates to manage actions, reducers, and maintain a predictable state.

**Non-Cognitive Functions**: Emulate non-cognitive functionalities initially.

**API Handling**: Implement effective API request handling within the brain areas and regions. 

**Scalability**: Focus on scalability rather than edge cases for the MVP. Plan for extensibility and flexibility in the future.

**Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests at a later stage.

**Code Demonstration**: Demonstrate how Redux.java can be used for state management by providing simple code snippets. Adhere to Redux principles, ensuring a single source of truth (the store) and predictable state changes.

**Action, Reducer, and Store Separation**: Remember to separate the actions, reducers, and store appropriately.

**API Integration Modules**: Plan for robust API integration modules to handle requests, responses, and potential errors gracefully.

**Functional Programming**: Follow functional programming paradigms as closely as possible.
