# Update system services
# Run this script with superuser privileges

# Modify or create systemd service unit files as needed to match the CerebrumOS structure.

# Example:
# Create a new systemd service unit file, e.g., cerebellum.service
# You can copy an existing service file as a template.

# Edit the service file to match the CerebrumOS structure and requirements.

# Use 'systemctl' to enable and start your services.

# For example, to enable and start the cerebellum service:
# systemctl enable cerebellum.service
# systemctl start cerebellum.service

echo "System services have been updated."
